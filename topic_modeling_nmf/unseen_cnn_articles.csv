https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/06/tech/nuro-self-driving-vehicle-houston-dot/index.html,US clears the way for this self-driving vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals,"Nuro, based in Mountain View, California, is now able to launch up to 5,000 of its R2 autonomous vehicles over the next two years, according to the US Department of Transportation. The R2 has no steering wheel, pedals or side mirrors as it's designed to be unmanned and carry cargo. Large compartments on its side open up to reveal deliveries, such as groceries or pizza. Nuro said it will initially deploy the R2 in six zip codes in Houston, covering 160,000 residents. It plans to start delivering Domino's pizza in Houston soon, although it didn't specify an exact date. In December, the company announced a partnership with Walmart to test autonomous grocery delivery in Houston sometime this year. The federal government has told self-driving companies to apply for exemptions to its vehicle standards in order to more quickly get innovative technologies onto roadways. Nuro is the first company to receive an exemption from the Department of Transportation's Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, which requires cars to have a long list of safety features including airbags and seat belts. ""Since this is a low-speed self-driving delivery vehicle, certain features that the department traditionally required -- such as mirrors and windshield for vehicles carrying drivers -- no longer make sense,"" said Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao in a statement. The R2 is also classified as a low-speed vehicle so it doesn't have to meet the same safety requirements as cars and SUVs. Low-speed vehicles can only go as fast as 25 miles per hour and must not weigh more than 2,500 pounds. Nuro is required to report any crash-related information to the federal government and to periodically report general information about the R2's operation. A spokeswoman for the Department of Transportation declined to offer additional details on what other data must be provided. ""One will need to look at the fine print of the reporting requirements to fully assess if NHTSA will be requiring robust enough information on adverse events to fully quantify the risks and benefits of the deployments,"" said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist in the MIT AgeLab and the associate director of the New England University Transportation Center at MIT. ""I'm glad to see that this is only for low speed deployments as one needs to walk before anyone is allowed to run."" Initially, the R2 will be followed by a vehicle with a human driver who will monitor it and intervene remotely if needed. The R2 is already being tested on private land. Nuro plans to build only a few hundred R2s in its first year and will remain focused on Houston for the time being. It expects to produce thousands more vehicles once it releases its next-generation R3. The company did not say when it plans to release the R3.  Unlike most self-driving companies, Nuro is focused on carrying goods rather than people. There are fewer safety and ethical questions when an autonomous vehicle is carrying groceries than a human being. Such questions as to whether a pedestrian or a passenger should be prioritized in a crash can be avoided. Most self-driving companies have not applied for government exemptions as they continue to develop and alter their vehicles. Companies offering self-driving rides today, such as Alphabet's Waymo, are relying on vehicles that include traditional car components, including steering wheel, pedals and mirrors, which have given them a quicker path to deployment.",4/11/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/10/success/managing-a-team-remotely-in-a-crisis/index.html,How to manage a team remotely during this crisis,"A deadly pandemic, an economic implosion and a new way of working has created a lot of distracted, anxious employees who now legitimately worry about job security.  Yet you still have to deliver on projects, train and coach, settle disputes and engage the team.  ""We are integrating remote work in an emergency situation and that has emotional duress tied to it,"" said Sara Sutton, CEO and founder of the career site FlexJobs.  Here are five ways to successfully manage the situation and your team:  1. Reassess priorities and offer clear direction Nothing is business as usual anymore. ""Ask your higher-ups what the top priorities are now,"" Sutton said.  That way you can help your team figure out where they should direct their energies. The last thing they need is to be working in isolation and wondering, ""Is this what they want?"" Offering your team clarity of purpose also helps with productivity and profits.  ""Especially in recessionary times, employees do best when leaders set clear expectations. Give them the resources they need to get the job done. And help them see how their work fits in with the bigger purpose of the organization,"" said Jim Harter, Gallup's chief scientist in workplace management and well-being. 2. Be flexible The magnitude of what is happening hits everyone at different times. Even normal errands can take up more mental space than imagined, like strategizing the best time to get groceries safely and quickly.  For employees with young kids, life has become a 24/7 stress test and many may need to adjust their work hours to accommodate family crunch times. They have no child care and are actively overseeing their children's remote learning while working. ""You have to respect each person's family situation and adjust timelines to that. People are working different hours now. You have to be a bit more adaptable to that than in the past,"" Harter said. 3. Set a positive tone With millions of people suddenly out of work and more to come, remind yourself and your team that whatever frustrations people have with remote working, you're really fortunate to be able to do it and get paid. It's also helpful to start meetings with some friendly banter and ask everyone how they are doing, Sutton said. Recognize individuals for work well done and continue to help them think about their career development, Harter suggested. Since you may feel inaccessible to others because you're not in the same place, you might purposefully set up a regular time to connect individually with each team member.  4. Look for signs of distress This crisis affects everyone. Retirement and college savings have been hit. Spouses are losing jobs. No one is seeing family. And increasingly, people know someone who has died from Covid-19. But some employees may have a harder time handling it all. Signs of extreme duress include drinking too much, abusing drugs, disengaging or being much more negative and combative than usual. ""Managers have to engage in a more conscious way than they did before. You take for granted the ability to check in on someone's well-being when you see them every day,"" said Tom Miller, CEO of employee risk management firm ClearForce. Periodically remind your whole team how to access your company's employee assistance programs -- which can include mental health, addiction and grief counseling, financial coaching and other wellness resources. And if you sense someone is struggling, be especially attentive. Doing so lets them know you care about their well-being, which is critical now. But you may also prevent problems for your company later, since employees under duress are more likely to make costly mistakes, flout rules and regulations, and become vulnerable to manipulation from foreign governments, hackers and other outside actors wanting access to company systems, Miller said. 5. Take care of yourself, too Managers should regularly encourage team members to take care of themselves in the midst of this crisis. And you should take your own advice. ""Model what you're advising your team to do,"" Sutton said. ""Exercise, keep to a work schedule, take breaks. Breathe. It's okay to tell your team this is hard for you, too."" In fact, showing that vulnerability can help develop openness and trust with your team, which will pay dividends for years to come.",4/11/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/13/economy/unemployment-gig-workers-challenges/index.html,Congress extended unemployment assistance to gig workers. But they're struggling to access it,"As a freelance copywriter for outdoor, fitness and other brands, spring and summer are usually the busiest times of the year for Sheff-Atteberry. But this year, as the coronavirus crisis spread across the United States, that work dried up.  ""Right now, there are no new projects ... I'm making about 20% of my normal income, which is obviously really difficult,"" Sheff-Atteberry said.  The situation has left her scrambling to get financial assistance through the CARES Act lawmakers passed last month, but accessing that aid has proven difficult.  ""I feel like I'm in a really terrible lottery,"" she said. ""I want to put food on my table, I want to pay a very large sum of bills.""  Across the country, many other freelancers, independent contractors and self-employed people saw their finances take a hit by coronavirus, with lost gigs, fewer projects and canceled speaking events — and now they're struggling to access government aid.  The percentage of workers in ""alternative"" working arrangements, such as food delivery drivers and other independent contractors, has risen dramatically over the past decade. The CARES Act extends to such workers unemployment benefits for which they are not usually eligible and enables independent contractors and sole proprietors to apply for business aid through the Paycheck Protection Program.  But in seeking access to those benefits, some freelancers say they've encountered a system that did not seem set up to handle applications for self-employed people. Many states are still working to retool their technology systems to process such workers' claims, and there are lingering questions about eligibility. In the meantime, workers say they're worried about when — and if — the money will come through. Waiting to access unemployment Gig workers who file taxes using 1099 forms are typically not eligible for unemployment benefits, so for many it was a relief when lawmakers expanded access to benefits amid the coronavirus pandemic. But applying for and receiving those benefits is still a ways off for most.  In Colorado, where Sheff-Atteberry lives, the state unemployment office has yet to open up applications for self-employed people.  ""We are still programming our systems to begin accepting claims for workers who are eligible for benefits related to the CARES Act, including those who are self-employed,"" the Colorado Department of Labor and Unemployment said in an April 12 statement on its website. ""Benefits will be retroactive and eligible claimants will not lose benefits while you wait to file a claim. We appreciate your understanding."" Elsewhere, self-employed workers have been able to file unemployment benefits claims but have faced other challenges.  Bradley Madsen, a freelance musician in New Jersey, said he applied for unemployment within 24 hours of the CARES Act passing. Weeks later, he said his application is still listed as ""pending.""  ""They have not moved it forward. When I called, I finally got someone on the phone and they said nothing could be done until it was moved past that,"" Madsen said.  All of the gigs Madsen had scheduled through the end of May have been canceled because of coronavirus. Now, as his family tries to survive on his wife's income alone, he's worried he will have to dip into savings that he'd intended to reinvest in his business.  ""It's taken several years to build up that capital to be able to make those investments,"" he said. ""It's stuff that I don't want to touch if I can avoid it, but I don't know how long I can avoid it."" In California, Stephany Wilkes, a writer and consultant in the textile industry, also created an account on the state's unemployment site last week, but found the process confusing.  Whereas full time workers' earnings are filed with the state by their employers, Wilkes said that as a self-employed worker, it was difficult to quantify and explain in a small form field just how much of her work had been lost.  ""There's no place to communicate: This is the money I would have earned,"" Wilkes said, adding that the form still seemed geared toward W2 workers, not freelancers. The California form she filled out, for example, does not ask whether the applicant is self-employed until near the end of the form, after it requests information on previous employers and wages.  California says it will take time to build and staff ""this complex new program"" that ""likely rivals"" the size of its current unemployment benefits system.  In addition to rolling out a new program, many states are likely overwhelmed by the number of unemployment claims they're receiving. First-time claims for unemployment benefits surged more than 3,000% from early March. About 16.8 million American workers, comprising about 11% of the US labor force, filed initial claims for jobless benefits last month.  Other avenues for help Theoretically, self-employed workers could have more access to coronavirus-related financial assistance than other full-time workers who are laid off or furloughed from their jobs. Many are applying for both unemployment benefits and Economic Injury Disaster or Payment Protection Program loans from the Small Business Administration.  But accessing those benefits has also proven difficult. Jane Richards, a sole-proprietor public relations consultant in California, sought to apply for SBA aid after losing about 30% of her business amid the pandemic and fearing she'd soon lose more.  But she was ineligible to apply at her primary bank, which is only accepting applications from people with business accounts or credit cards, something she hasn't needed as a freelancer.  ""I don't have a payroll, so I haven't had to think about (having a business account),"" Richards said. ""It's just me. But it seems like I'm the exact type of person that this was made to help. I've just, at this point, given up. I don't think I'm going to be able to get it."" There have also been long wait times and overwhelmed systems at the SBA and banks that are facilitating the business aid loan programs.  Madsen said he applied for the Economic Injury Disaster Loan, and called the SBA a week later to check on the progress of his application. When he got on the line, he found himself in a queue of around 1,900 callers. After nearly an hour and a half of waiting, he finally got someone on the phone.  ""They said it was processing and they said I would get an email once they had processed it and decided whether I was going to get something or not,"" Madsen said. ""So, yeah, I'm still sitting here."" In the meantime, workers say they're spending time trying to understand the various avenues for assistance that could otherwise be used to find new work.  ""You have to do so much research before you even know if it's right,"" Wilkes said. ""Maybe it turns out to be something you don't need, or that it's not worth your trouble to apply for. But the amount of reading and research and forms you have to go through before you can even make that choice is hard.""",4/13/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/06/media/federal-response-coronavirus-reliable-sources/index.html,Stelter: Federal response to pandemic is a 9/11-level failure ,"There's a lot of revisionist history being written right now. Lots of digging of the so-called memory hole. Pro-Trump media outlets are trying to bury the Trump White House's failures to fully protect the country from this pandemic. They're trying with all their might to shift the blame to mayors and governors. Look: There were shortcomings on the local and state levels. But the federal government wields far more power and influence. The president has far more influence and far more responsibility than any governor. So it should be said loudly and clearly and repeatedly: This was a 9/11-level failure of the federal government. As I argued on Sunday's ""Reliable Sources"" telecast, the government's failures need to be covered and scrutinized accordingly. To ignore what went wrong -- or to cover it up or to memory-hole it — does a disservice to the dead. WaPo editor: Government 'failed all along the way' Washington Post editor Marty Baron said it best on Sunday's program. Relaying the findings from this Page One investigation, Baron said ""the government didn't act like this was a war from the very beginning."" ""And everything stems from the person at the top,"" Baron said, when I asked about the president's responsibility. ""From the very beginning he was being dismissive of this -- of the dangers here."" Watch... Reminder: The #'s are woefully incomplete The Post and The New York Times both have front-page stories about this problem in Monday's print editions. WaPo's Emma Brown, Beth Reinhard and Aaron C. Davis write: ""The fast-spreading novel coronavirus is almost certainly killing Americans who are not included in the nation's growing death toll, according to public health experts and government officials involved in the tally."" The NYT's Sarah Kliff and Julie Bosman: ""Inconsistent protocols, limited resources and a patchwork of decision-making has led to an undercounting of people with the coronavirus who have died, health experts say."" So it's even worse than we think On the right-wing web, there are complaints and conspiracy theories about alleged over-counting of Covid-19 deaths. But the truth is, as Kliff and Bosman wrote, ""the true death toll is likely much higher"" than we know. Among the reasons why: ""In many rural areas, coroners say they don't have the tests they need to detect the disease. Doctors now believe that some deaths in February and early March, before the coronavirus reached epidemic levels in the United States, were likely misidentified as influenza or only described as pneumonia."" The news coverage needs to reflect this awful reality... Two key quotes -- On ""Reliable,"" Gregg Gonsalves took exception to my opening comments. ""It's not a 9/11-level failure,"" he said. ""It's greater than that. As Andy Slavitt said, it's the greatest public health crisis in a hundred years..."" -- ""I've got physicians calling me saying I don't know if I'll ever see my child again,"" Dr. Nisha Mehta told me... FOR THE RECORD, PART ONE -- New reporting from Lachlan Cartwright and Asawin Suebsaeng: Dr. Oz ""has been advising senior Trump admin officials on coronavirus-related matters"" and Oz's hits on Fox have caught Trump's attention... (Beast) -- Danny Meyer on Sunday's ""60 Minutes:"" ""This virus has, for me, been almost like a hurricane with no wind, or a forest fire with no flame."" Scott Pelley's segment was about business owners and the newly unemployed... (CBS) -- Surgeon General Jerome Adams preparing the country for the week ahead: ""This is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment..."" (CNN) -- David Remnick's newest column: ""These next weeks and months will be demanding in ways that are hard to fathom. If New Yorkers are in hiding, the virus has shown a knack for seeking. But, with time, life will return to the city..."" (The New Yorker)   Former IG watchdog addresses recent firing Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community inspector general who informed Congress of the whistleblower complaint that led to Trump's impeachment, ""said Sunday that he believes Trump fired him for doing his job,"" CNN's Caroline Kelly and Jeremy Herb report. Atkinson's public statement is remarkable and worth reading in full. He concludes with a message to employees and contractors who know of malfeasance: ""The American people deserve an honest and effective government. They are counting on you to use authorized channels to bravely speak up -- there is no disgrace in doing so. It is important to remember, as others have said, that the need for secrecy in the United States Intelligence Community is not a grant of power, but a grant of trust. Our government benefits when individuals are encouraged to report suspected fraud, waste, and abuse. I have faith that my colleagues in Inspectors General Offices throughout the federal government will continue to operate effective and independent whistleblower programs, and that they will continue to do everything in their power to protect the rights of whistleblowers. Please do not allow recent events to silence your voices."" About the WH briefing... On Sunday morning the White House indicated that there wouldn't be a task force briefing or any public appearance by the president during the day. Then the plan changed and the president scheduled an early evening briefing. There wasn't a lot of news, but there was a lot of huffing and puffing. ""Here's the problem: These are not briefings,"" David Axelrod tweeted during the briefing. ""These are sales pitches from POTUS on his own behalf -- laced with shots at whoever he's mad at that day and weird side trips to push untested drugs. What people need is useful 411 about what we need to do and should expect."" ""Trump pitches drug unapproved for coronavirus"" That's the AP's fact-check headline... The newswire's team notes that the preisdent's advocacy of hydroxychloroquine ""is the latest and one of the most consequential examples of Trump and public-health authorities not being on the same page in the pandemic."" CNN's Jeremy Diamond pressed Trump during the briefing: ""Why not just let the science speak for itself? Why are you promoting this drug?"" ""I'm not. I'm not. I'm not at all,"" Trump said. Then he continued promoting it: ""I want them to try it. It may work and it may not work."" Doctors are already trying it, but it is not a proven treatment for coronavirus. When Diamond asked Fauci to comment on the matter, Trump stepped in and didn't allow Fauci to answer. Maggie Haberman called it a ""really jarring moment..."" Trump cuts off AP reporter Toward the end of the briefing, Kevin Freking of the AP attempted to ask about his colleague Michael Biesecker's scoop. Biesecker reported that ""federal agencies largely waited until mid-March to begin placing bulk orders of N95 respirator masks, mechanical ventilators and other equipment needed by front-line health care workers."" As Kaitlan Collins noted, ""the reporter didn't even finish his question, only mentioned 'the equipment issue' before Trump cut him off and asked where he works. Then said 'they have done an unbelievable job' and 'you should be thanking them for what they have done, not always asking wise guy questions.'"" Tapper directly addresses Trump: Do you have a plan? Oliver Darcy emails: Jake Tapper concluded ""SOTU"" on Sunday by looking into the camera and speaking directly to Trump. Tapper noted that the American people ""need someone to explain what is going to be done"" to get out of this crisis. ""It's a moment that requires leadership. It requires honest information. It requires empathy and it requires a plan,"" Tapper said. ""Do you have one?""",4/6/2020
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/10/tech/nintendo-switch-shipment-pause-shortage/index.html,Nintendo pauses Nintendo Switch shipments to Japan amid global shortage,"The company confirmed to CNN Business that there will be no new shipments of the Nintendo Switch and the Switch Lite this week to Japan apart from pre-orders. It tweeted in Japanese on Tuesday that it would update customers next week on the shipping schedule. ""Demand for Nintendo Switch soared thanks to 'Animal Crossing: New Horizons' and the surge in home gaming during Covid-19,"" Lisa Hanson, president of Niko Partners, a research firm that focuses on the gaming industry in Asia, told CNN Business.  She noted that sales of the Switch in Japan surged 240% in March compared to a year ago. ""Nintendo could be mitigating the short global supply issue by limiting shipments to Japan when demand there may be lower in April after big sales in March,"" Hanson added. On February 6, Nintendo announced it was dealing with production delays in China due to the ongoing pandemic. Even though Nintendo began to move part of its manufacturing to Vietnam in 2019, it still relies on China for supply. The company declined to say how much the supply chain has recovered since then. Niko Partners said it did not expect Nintendo to meet demand in April, and that sales would continue to be determined by supply. Nintendo America said in a statement, ""Nintendo Switch hardware is selling out at various retail locations in the U.S., but more systems are on the way. We apologize for any inconvenience."" Prices of the Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite have skyrocketed above their retail prices, despite the Switch being more than three years old. In China, the price has nearly doubled to $560 (4,000 RMB) from roughly $299. On Walmart's website, the ""Animal Crossing"" edition of the Switch is now marked up to $800.   Nintendo declined to comment on current sales figures and when it would resume shipments. The company reports earnings on May 7, when it typically publishes sales data.",4/12/2020
